This is a set of scripts that will:

- capture images from one or more cameras with TCP/IP interface
- create videos from the images
- display the images on a web page
- transfer images to an image repository
- optionally notify about image changes using MQTT
- enforce a retention policy for images and videos


Pre-installation

Configure each camera with a user who is authorized to capture images.  This is
typically a user with no administrative privileges.

Cameras are identified by IP address or hostname.

Be sure that the machine on which eyesee is running can ping each camera.


Installation

1) install the components
  install.sh

2) modify the configuration files
  /etc/default/eyesee         - list of cameras
  /etc/eyesee/eyesee.cfg      - parameters for each camera
  /etc/eyesee/eyesee-cfg.js   - which cameras to display in web pages

3) start the daemon
  /etc/init.d/eyesee start

4) restart the web server
  /etc/init.d/apache2 restart
 

Installation options

Use the PREFIX and DATADIR options to specify installation and data locations:

PREFIX=/opt/eyesee DATADIR=/var/eyesee install.sh

To select a specific user/group identifier:

EYESEE_UID=505 EYESEE_GID=505 install.sh


Configuration option

See eyesee-defaults.cfg and eyesee-defaults.js for all of the options.
