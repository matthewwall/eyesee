This is a set of scripts that will:

- capture images from one or more cameras with TCP/IP interface
- create videos from the images
- display the images on a web page
- transfer images to an image repository
- optionally notify about image changes using MQTT
- enforce a retention policy for images and videos


Pre-installation

Configure each camera with a user who is authorized to capture images.  This is
typically a user with no administrative privileges.

Cameras are identified by IP address or hostname, so be sure that each camera
has a static IP address and/or hostname.

Be sure that the machine on which eyesee is running can ping each camera.


Installation

1) install the components
  install.sh

2) modify the configuration files
  /etc/eyesee/eyesee.cfg    - parameters for each camera
  /etc/eyesee/eyesee.js     - which cameras to display in web pages
  /etc/default/eyesee       - list of cameras for image capture using daemon
  /etc/cron.d/eyesee        - list of cron entries for image capture using cron

3) restart the web server
  /etc/init.d/apache2 restart

4) test by grabbing a single image from each camera
  su eyesee
  /opt/eyesee/bin/getimg.pl --host x.x.x.x --verbose

5) start the daemon and configure to start at system boot
  /etc/init.d/eyesee start
  update-rc.d eyesee defaults


Installation options

Use the PREFIX and DATADIR options to specify installation and data locations:

PREFIX=/opt/eyesee DATADIR=/var/eyesee install.sh

To select a specific user/group identifier:

EYESEE_UID=505 EYESEE_GID=505 install.sh


Configuration option

See eyesee-defaults.cfg and eyesee-defaults.js for all of the options.


Configuration for nginx

You must install and configure fastcgi.  See nginx/eyesee.conf for details.
